Service-Now Script CLI
======================

So far this only allows you to download business rules and clients scripts, eventually the goal is for you to be able to download and upload all of the script types.

You must update the xml configuration file that is created when you build the project with the URL of your service-now instance.

The JSON Web Service Plugin must be enabled in your instance.
